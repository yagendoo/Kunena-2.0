*Kunena* is installed via the Joomla component/extension installer. You may download our builds/packages from joomlacode.org via: http://joomlacode.org/gf/project/kunena/frs/ or from our downloads manager at: http://www.kunena.org/download

The Joomla installers allows you to directly install *Kunena* via package URL or from a local download of yours.

As long as the minimum requirements are met, the Kunena install should take only a few moments. We have spent a great amount of time to automate the entire installation process.

Upgrades are performed just like new installs. There is no need to uninstall Kunena to perform an upgrade. We STRONGLY recommend that you perform a backup before and new software install or upgrade. The upgrade procedure is identical to a new install and is performed via the Joomla extension installer. *Kunena* will detect all prior version of Kunena and will perform the necessary upgrade tasks fully automatic.
